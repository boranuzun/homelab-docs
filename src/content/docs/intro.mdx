This is the technical documentation site for my **Bachelor's thesis project** at the [Haute école de gestion de Genève](https://www.hesge.ch/heg). The project is titled:

> **Conception et déploiement automatisé d'un Operating System as Code à l'aide de pratiques Infrastructure as Code.**

## Main Objective

The aim of this project is to design and automate the deployment of a personal **homelab server** by applying modern practices like **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, **GitOps**, and **DevSecOps**. This approach ensures that infrastructure configuration is:

| Principle              | Description                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Version-controlled** | All changes are tracked in Git and pushed to a remote repository |
| **Reproducible**       | Systems can be rebuilt reliably from the same source             |
| **Maintainable**       | Make updates and fixes easier to apply and track                 |
| **Secure**             | Sensitive data is encrypted and managed properly                 |

## What You'll Find Here

This site documents the tools, processes, and architecture I use to:

- Build a **NixOS-based virtual machine** on **Proxmox**
- Configure and manage infrastructure with **OpenTofu**
- Secure secrets using **SOPS + age**
- Automate deployments with **GitHub Actions**
- Run useful services in **Docker containers**

All configuration is **written as code**, versioned in Git, and fully reproducible.

## Services and Architecture

The homelab environment is built on a **NixOS** virtual machine hosted on a **Proxmox** hypervisor. This VM provides a platform for deploying and managing several containerized services, including:

- **[Traefik](https://traefik.io)** — reverse proxy
- **[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com)** — private mesh VPN
- **[Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma)** — uptime monitoring
- **[Speedtest Tracker](https://docs.speedtest-tracker.dev/)** — internet speed monitoring
- **[Dozzle](https://dozzle.dev/)** — real-time log viewer
- **[Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/)** — automatic container updates
- **[Homepage](https://gethomepage.dev/)** — service dashboard
- **[Gotify](https://gotify.net/)** — notification server

This documentation serves as a **technical reference** throughout the project and may serve other students or professionals exploring reproducible, code-driven infrastructure design.
