OpenTofu is a powerful tool for managing infrastructure as code. In this section, we'll walk through the steps to set up OpenTofu for building a NixOS VM on Proxmox.

## Prerequisites

- **Proxmox**: Ensure you have a Proxmox server set up and accessible.
- **OpenTofu**: Install OpenTofu on your local machine. You can follow the [installation guide](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install/) for detailed instructions.
- **NixOS ISO**: Download the latest minimal [NixOS ISO](https://nixos.org/download/) image and upload it to your Proxmox server. See this [guide](upload-iso-proxmox) for instructions on how to upload the ISO.
