**CI/CD** stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment**. It is a fundamental practice in modern DevOps workflows that focuses on automating the building, testing, and deployment of code whenever changes are pushed to a version control system like Git.

## Why Use CI/CD?

CI/CD brings several advantages to infrastructure and software projects:

- **Automation** — Replaces manual steps with automated pipelines
- **Speed** — Accelerates feedback and deployment loops
- **Reliability** — Reduces the risk of human error
- **Consistency** — Ensures changes are applied the same way every time
- **Collaboration** — Allows teams to work more efficiently with shared workflows

## CI/CD in This Project

In this homelab project, CI/CD is used to automatically rebuild and deploy the **NixOS configuration** and the **containerized services** whenever changes are made to the configuration files in the Git repository.

This means:

- Any update to `configuration.nix` or related files is instantly picked up
- A GitHub Actions pipeline validates the configuration and applies it
- The remote NixOS VM is updated without needing to log in manually

This approach is crucial for maintaining a **declarative**, **reproducible**, and **hands-off** infrastructure environment.

## Tool Used

- **GitHub Actions** — Used to trigger workflows when commits are pushed
- **OpenSSH** — Securely connects to the remote NixOS machine
- **nixos-rebuild** — Rebuilds the system from the updated configuration
- **Tailscale Github Action** — Used to connect to the NixOS VM over a secure mesh network
