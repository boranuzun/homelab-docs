This documentation site was created as part of my Bachelor's thesis at the **[Haute école de gestion de Genève](https://www.hesge.ch/heg/)**. The project is titled:

> **Conception et déploiement automatisé d’un Operating System as Code à l’aide de pratiques Infrastructure as Code.**

## Main Objective

The aim of this project is to design and automate the deployment of a personal **homelab server** by applying modern practices like **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, **GitOps**, and **DevSecOps**. This approach ensures that infrastructure configuration is:

| Principle              | Description                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Version-controlled** | All changes are tracked in Git and pushed to a remote repository |
| **Reproducible**       | Systems can be rebuilt reliably from the same source             |
| **Maintainable**       | Make updates and fixes easier to apply and track                 |
| **Secure**             | Sensitive data is encrypted and managed properly                 |

To apply these principles, I’m building a personal **homelab** environment using a **NixOS** virtual machine hosted on a **Proxmox** hypervisor. This VM provides a platform for deploying and managing services using declarative and automated workflows.

On this VM, I will deploy several containerized services, including:

- **[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com)** — private mesh VPN
- **[AdGuard Home](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-home/overview.html)** — DNS-level ad and tracker blocking
- **[Homepage](https://github.com/gethomepage/homepage)** — service dashboard
- **[Traefik](https://traefik.io)** — reverse proxy
- **[Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma)** — uptime monitoring
- **[Watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower)** — automatic container updates

## Tools and Technologies

Here’s a non-exhaustive list of tools and technologies involved:

- **OpenTofu** — Terraform-compatible open-source IaC tool
- **Proxmox** — Virtualization platform for managing VMs
- **NixOS** — Declarative and reproducible Linux distribution
- **SOPS + age** — Secure and versioned secrets management
- **GitHub Actions** — CI/CD automation for deployment pipelines
- **Docker Compose** — Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications
