This is the technical documentation site for my **Bachelor‚Äôs thesis project** at the [Haute √©cole de gestion de Gen√®ve](https://www.hesge.ch/heg).

The project focuses on building a reproducible, automated infrastructure using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** practices and tools. The goal is to create a **homelab** environment that is easy to manage, secure, and scalable.

## What You'll Find Here

This site documents the tools, processes, and architecture I use to:

- Build a **NixOS-based virtual machine** on **Proxmox**
- Configure and manage infrastructure with **OpenTofu**
- Secure secrets using **SOPS + age**
- Automate deployments with **GitHub Actions**
- Run useful services in **Docker containers**

All configuration is **written as code**, versioned in Git, and fully reproducible.
