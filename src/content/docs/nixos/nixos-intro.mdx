[NixOS](https://nixos.org) is a unique Linux distribution built around the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/). It introduces a **purely functional**, **declarative**, and **reproducible** approach to system configuration and package management.

Instead of configuring your system imperatively (manually installing packages, editing files, etc.), NixOS lets you define the entire state of your system in a single configuration file: `configuration.nix`. This makes it especially powerful for infrastructure automation and DevOps workflows.

## Why Use NixOS?

NixOS offers several key benefits that make it ideal for homelabs and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) environments:

- **Declarative Configuration**  
  Define your system state in code. Everything from installed packages to system services and user accounts is described in a single file.

- **Reproducibility**  
  Build the exact same system across machines or over time. You can rollback to previous configurations with ease.

- **Atomic Upgrades & Rollbacks**  
  System upgrades are safe and atomic. If something breaks, roll back instantly.

- **Isolation & Purity**  
  Nix ensures packages and builds are isolated, preventing conflicts and ensuring predictable behavior.

- **Built-in Versioning**  
  The Nix store and Git integration allow you to track, reproduce, and audit every system change.

## NixOS in This Project

In the context of this project, NixOS is the foundation of the **homelab VM**. Its declarative nature ensures that:

- All system configuration is version-controlled
- Services can be reliably deployed and re-deployed
- Rebuilding the system is as simple as running `nixos-rebuild switch`

By combining NixOS with tools like OpenTofu, GitHub Actions, and SOPS, we can fully automate, secure, and manage the infrastructure lifecycle using modern DevOps and GitOps practices.
