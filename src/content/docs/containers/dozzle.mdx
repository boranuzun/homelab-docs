Dozzle is a real-time log viewer for Docker containers. It allows you to view the logs of your containers in real-time, making it easier to debug and monitor your applications.

```yaml
// docker-compose.yaml
services:
  dozzle:
    image: amir20/dozzle:latest
    container_name: dozzle
    ports:
      - 8084:8080
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "/dozzle", "healthcheck"]
      interval: 3s
      timeout: 30s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 30s
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Configuration

You can access Dozzle by navigating to `http://localhost:8084` in your web browser. The interface provides a simple way to view logs from all running containers, filter logs by container, and search through the logs.

## Usage
To use Dozzle, simply start your Docker containers as usual. Dozzle will automatically detect running containers and display their logs in real-time. You can click on a container to view its logs, filter logs by keywords, and even pause or resume log streaming.
